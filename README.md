Here RRT-star connect algorithm is used to find the optimized path between the start and the end without colliding with the obstacles.

We can optimize it more by increasing the number of nodes but at the same time we also need to reduce the time it takes to find the path hence an adequate quantity of nodes are to be fixed.
